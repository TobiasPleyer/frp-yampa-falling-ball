# yampa-ball

A very basic console animation of a falling ball in
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) using the
[Yampa](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Yampa) framework. This is meant as
a simple example for functional reactive programming (FRP).

The code is partly inspired by a youtube video of
[jekor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IpE0CyHK7Q).
